# Hands-off-Nose
This is my Code in Place 2025 project â€” a real-time Python system that detects when a hand comes close to the nose using MediaPipe Face Mesh and Hands, triggering an audio alert. I built it after my own septorhinoplasty to help prevent accidental nose touching during recovery.  Useful for facial surgery patients or habit-tracking tools.
